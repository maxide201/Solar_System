        "name": "Moon",
        "description": "Already in ancient times, people knew that the moon revolves around the earth. Back in the II century. BC e. Hipparchus calculated the inclination of the lunar orbit to the plane of the ecliptic. Claudius Ptolemy continued the study of the motion of the moon around the earth. Isaac Newton perfectly explained the motion of the moon with the help of his law of gravitation. In the periods of the Moon's orbit, there are anomalistic (rotation relative to the orbital nodes of the Moon itself) and draconic (a segment of revolution relative to the point of the Moon's orbit closest to the Earth) months. Not only does the Moon revolve around the Earth, but the Earth also makes minor rotations around their common center of mass."

        "name": "Phobos",
        "description": "Phobos is one of the two moons of the planet Mars. It was discovered in 1877 by the American astronomer Asaf Hall. This satellite received its name from the eponymous ancient Greek god, the eternal companion of the god of war Ares, and the word 'phobos' itself is translated as 'fear'. This small cosmic body with a diameter of 22.2 kilometers is located from the center of Mars at a distance of only 2.77 of the radius of this planet and makes a revolution around it in 7 hours and 39 minutes, which even surpasses Mars if we consider its rotation around its own axis. In the Martian sky, Phobos rises in the west, and sunset in the east. It is always turned to Mars on one side, since the period of rotation around its axis coincides with the period of revolution around the planet. Due to its low mass (1,072x10 16 kg) Phobos does not have its own atmosphere. The low density of the satellite indicates that it has a porous structure, with voids accounting for up to 45% of its volume. The most visible formation on the moon's surface is Stickney Crater, which is 9 kilometers in diameter. The formation of this crater is associated with the collision of a satellite with an asteroid. Also, not far from the crater, mysterious parallel grooves of unknown origin, 100-200 meters wide and up to 20 meters deep, were discovered."

        "name": "Deimos",
        "description": "In ancient Greek mythology, this was the name of the two eternal companions of the war deity Ares (Mars). The name Deimos means 'Horror'. This satellite is inferior in size to its fellow. Its diameter is 13 kilometers (at Phobos, for comparison, 22.2 kilometers), and dimensions are 15 x 12.2 x 10.4 kilometers. Deimos is much farther from Mars than Phobos, at a distance of 6.96 of the planet's radius, and orbits it in thirty hours, seventeen minutes and 55 seconds. Like the Moon and Phobos, Deimos has a period of rotation around the axis that coincides with the period of revolution around the planet, which is why it is always turned to Mars on one side. The planet's tidal force causes Deimos to gradually move away from it. Roughly the same thing happens with the Earth's satellite - the Moon. Deimos is dominated by stony rocks, and its surface, like the lunar, is covered with a layer of regolith, which explains its relative smoothness. There are several hypotheses about the origin of the satellites of Mars, according to one of which, Phobos and Deimos are two former asteroids with a distorted orbit, captured by the gravity of Mars."

        "name": "Io",
        "description": "Io is the closest satellite to Jupiter (422 thousand kilometers). Io's orbital period is shorter than the lunar month (42.5 hours), this is due to the giant mass of Jupiter. A special feature of Io is that it is volcanically active. On its surface, 12 active volcanoes have been discovered, which spew out mainly sulfur dioxide (settles on the surface in the form of a white matter). The volcanically active regions of Io are heated to 300 C. On its surface lies the large Loki lava sea (200 km diagonally). The activity of volcanoes is explained by the gravitational influence from other celestial bodies of the Jupiter system. Again, volcanic activity explains the absence of impact craters on Io's surface (they are simply recycled by sediment). In the bowels of this moon of Jupiter is an iron core."

        "name": "Europa",
        "description": "The radius of Europe is 1569 km. Its surface is covered with ice and has a light shade. Under the ice, in all likelihood, there is a giant ocean that hides a silicate core in its depths. Europe has a smooth surface (there are no impact craters and elevations over 100 m), which is covered with dark and light stripes of great length. The dark streaks are obviously crack marks. The age of Europe is still quite 'young', 'only' 100 million years old."

        "description": "Ganymede is a giant satellite, and not only relative to the Jupiter system, but also to the entire solar system (its radius is 2631 km). Its surface is 40% covered with ice, which is all covered with 'scars' from meteorite bombardments. The remaining 60% of the satellite is covered with strange grooves."

        "description": "Callisto is the satellite farthest from Jupiter (1.88 million km). It, like Europa, is covered with ice, but unlike it, many meteorite craters can be found on the surface of Callisto. This moon of Jupiter owes its dark color to various impurities, for example, silicate. At one time, the impact of a meteorite formed a huge formation on Callisto, which was named Valhalla. In the center of this formation is a huge crater (diameter - 350 km), and around it are ring-shaped mountain ranges."

        "description": "Enceladus is the sixth-largest moon of Saturn. It is about 500 kilometers (310 mi) in diameter, about a tenth of that of Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Enceladus is mostly covered by fresh, clean ice, making it one of the most reflective bodies of the Solar System. Consequently, its surface temperature at noon only reaches −198 °C (−324 °F), far colder than a light-absorbing body would be. Despite its small size, Enceladus has a wide range of surface features, ranging from old, heavily cratered regions to young, tectonically deformed terrain"

        "name": "Titan",
        "description": "Titan is the largest moon of Saturn, its mass is 20 times the mass of all other satellites of this planet combined. In the entire solar system, only Jupiter's moon Ganymede is larger than Titan. Titan's diameter is even larger than that of Mercury and is 5150 kilometers. The radius of the orbit along which this satellite revolves around Saturn is 1.222 million km. In terms of its internal structure, Titan is close to the moons of Jupiter - Ganymede and Callisto. It possesses a stone core and an ice mantle. But, unlike Jupiter's satellites, due to the greater distance from the Sun, Titan, apparently, in addition to ordinary water ice, also contains ice formed by methane and ammonia."

        "name": "Phoebe",
        "description": "The darkest and most distant moon of Saturn is Phoebe, which orbits this giant planet in the opposite direction at a distance of 12.95 million kilometers. It was discovered in 1898 by an astronomer from the United States - W. Pickering. Phoebe is characterized by an irregular shape. Its diameter is 220 kilometers. It takes Phoebe a year and a half to make a complete revolution around Saturn.. As you know, in Jupiter, as well as in Saturn, the outer boundaries of the satellite system are represented by satellites revolving in the opposite direction around the giant planet. This indicates a similar origin of these cosmic bodies with Phoebe.. Presumably, Phoebe is not the farthest moon of Saturn, and, according to some scientists, at the edge of the satellite system of this giant planet there are still undiscovered satellites of small diameter."

        "name": "Iapetus",
        "description": "The diameter of this satellite of Saturn is 1440 km, and the radius of its orbit is 3.561 million kilometers. An important feature of Iapetus is a sharp asymmetry in the brightness of the hemispheres: one hemisphere is 10 times brighter than the other! It is believed that the dark color of one of the sides of this cosmic body is to blame for another satellite of Saturn - Phoebus, which bombards its neighbor with fine dark dust. The surface of Iapetus is highly cratered. This satellite was discovered in 1671 by J.D. Cassini."

        "name": "Hyperion",
        "description": "Saturn's moon Hyperion has a dark surface color and irregular shape. Its dimensions are 330 x 240 x 200 km. Hyperion is characterized by a chaotic proper rotation with a period that changes by several tens of percent at once over several weeks. With another satellite of Saturn, Titan, it is associated with a 4: 3 resonance. This means that while Titan makes 4 revolutions around Saturn, Hyperion makes three revolutions around it. The radius of the orbit of Hyperion is 1.481 million kilometers. This satellite was discovered in 1848 by American scientists George and William Bond, and at the same time, independently of the Americans, by the English astronomer William Lassell."

        "description": "Uranus' satellite Miranda was discovered on February 16, 1948 by the American scientist J. Kuiper. It is the smallest among the five moons of the planet. Miranda got its name in honor of the character of the famous play 'The Tempest' by W. Shakespeare, since by tradition all the satellites of Uranus received the names of the main characters of the works of William Shakespeare. Due to its great distance from the Earth, this satellite was photographed only once; in 1986, the Voyager 2 spacecraft flew near it (at a distance of 31,000 meters), capturing its southern hemisphere. After investigating the surface of Miranda using infrared radiation, scientists came to the conclusion that the surface of the satellite consists of water ice, which is mixed with compounds of carbonates and silicates."

It is the second-largest and second most massive of the Uranian moons, and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System. Discovered by William Herschel in 1787, Oberon is named after the mythical king of the fairies who appears as a character in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Its orbit lies partially outside Uranus's magnetosphere."
