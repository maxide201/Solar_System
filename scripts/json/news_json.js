    "text": "SpaceX is far from the only privately-owned company to send cargo into space. Rocket Lab, founded in 2006, is also involved in this business. She is the creator of the Electron launch vehicle, which has been performing commercial orders since 2018 and can launch small loads weighing up to 300 kilograms into orbit of our planet. The company recently improved its rocket, making its first stage reusable - after the first use, it can be used several more times. On the morning of November 20, the company launched the Electron rocket and successfully returned its first stage back to Earth. The landing of the stage was successful - no serious damage is visible in the photo published by the head of the Rocket Lab company Peter Beck (Peter Beck). It is important to note that the stage landed thanks to a parachute."

    "text": "American entrepreneur Elon Musk(Elon Musk) is not only engaged in the production of electric cars and spaceships. In 2015, he created Starlink, a company whose goal is to provide Internet to the inhabitants of even the most remote corners of our planet. Thanks to thousands of space satellites for distributing the Internet, villagers will be able to access social networks, watch YouTube and become full-fledged users of the world wide web. In the first half of 2020, the number of Starlink satellites in low-earth orbit exceeded 500, so the company decided to launch the system in test mode. Some residents of the USA and Canada were able to use the Internet from Elon Musk. They measured the download and upload speed of files, and also shared information about the latency (ping). In short, Starlink Internet has shown its best side."

    "date": "18.06.2020",

    "text": "An international team of scientists announced the first simultaneous transmission of an encrypted quantum message, which was sent from a space satellite to two ground-based telescopes located at a distance of 1,120 kilometers from each other. With such a secure communication channel, scientists managed to connect the cities of Nanshan and Delingha. True, while the data is transferred rather slowly - it takes about one and a half minutes to send one byte. According to the Spanish El Pais, despite the fact that quantum phenomena occur on a microscopic scale, they can affect the visible world."

    "text": "Our planet's satellite that reflects sunlight has always been an object of admiration. The very idea that a person could someday be able to walk on the surface of the moon was awe-inspiring. The era of space exploration, which was the result of the arms race between the two superpowers, the USSR and the United States, led to the landing of a man on the moon. This event is definitely one of the greatest achievements of humanity. However, since 1972, flights to the satellite of our planet have been suspended. Today, the world is again obsessed with the moon and many countries have announced plans to master it. Scientists recently compiled the world's first 'unified geological map of the moon' created in digital format. The map will be available to anyone online."

    "text": "Japan is the fourth largest space power in the world after the United States, Russia and China. Despite the fact that the country of the rising sun currently specializes mainly in launching orbiting satellites, in the near future Japan can make a real breakthrough in the field of aerospace projects. So, the Japanese space agency JAXA has officially announced that it plans to create a new mission to Mars, or rather, to one of the two Martian satellites - Phobos. If the ambitious plan of Japanese engineers works, mankind may have the first spacecraft in history that can not only fly to the Martian system, but also return back to Earth."

    "text": "Europa is one of Jupiter 's Galilean satellites , orbiting rather close to the giant planet. Scientists have been arguing for a long time about the presence of any alien life under the thick layer of ice of this small moon, because comprehensive observations using telescopes and spacecraft flying past the satellite have shown that a global ocean may be hidden under the surface of Europa, which is non-freezing due to the gravitational effect of its massive neighbor in the solar system. However, if subsequent missions can indeed detect life in Europa's ocean, what kind of life could it be?"

    "text": "Last month, SpaceX became the operator of the largest number of active satellites in the world. It is known that as of the end of January 2020, the company had 242 satellites orbiting the planet and planned to launch 42,000 more over the next decade. According to the founder of SpaceX, Elon Musk , the launch of such a large number of artificial satellites into orbit is only part of an ambitious project to provide global Internet access around the world. However, according to a study published on livescience.com , the huge number of satellites in orbit could pose a threat to all of humanity. So what is the catch of active deployment of orbital objects used primarily for communications?"
